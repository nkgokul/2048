# 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

This project was cloned from https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://nkgokul.github.io/2048/)

## Donations
I made this in my spare time, it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs) and I just made a single line code change to the parnet repository to help out the people who were not able to reach the 2048. So if you enjoyed the game and felt happing after showing the victory screen to your friends, you can donate at my BTC address: `1F5BJmYgyniDaTJ3eic4SJDHa5vJWHgUDr`. Thank you very much!
